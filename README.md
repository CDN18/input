## Why Input?

Input aims to be an alternative to proven tools like TypeForm, with the added benefit of self-hosting and having brandable forms out of the box.

We started Input out of a previous project called BotReach, which was already a conversational form tool, but closed-source. We plan to release a feature complete first MVP of Input in Q2 2022.

> We are in an early stage of developing and some of our planned features are currently not in the codebase. You can contact us via philipp@deck9.co to get on the waitlist or if you want to contribute to the development.

## Development

We are using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/master/sail) to develop Input. That means you need Docker installed to run Input on your local machine. We also recommend installing Node.JS and NPM on your host machine to make working with frontend assets more performant.
