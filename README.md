# Input - Engaging Forms on Brand

Input is a no-code application to create simple & clean forms. With our customization options, you can let the forms shine in your brands colors.

## Why Input?

Input aims to be an alternative to proven tools like TypeForm, with the added benefit of self-hosting and having brandable forms out of the box.

We started Input out of a previous project called BotReach, which was already a conversational form tool, but closed-source. We plan to release a feature complete first MVP of Input in Q2 2022.

> We are in an early stage of developing and some of our planned features are currently not in the codebase. You can contact us via philipp@deck9.co to get on the waitlist or if you want to contribute to the development.
