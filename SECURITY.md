# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our open source project is a top priority. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our repository, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Please follow these steps to report a security vulnerability:

1. Do Not Publicly Disclose: Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly or to any third parties. By keeping the issue private until we resolve it, we can prevent potential misuse and provide security for our users.

2. Use GitHub Advisories: Report the vulnerability directly using GitHub Security Advisories in our repository. This will allow you to report a vulnerability privately to the project maintainers.

3. Provide Details: Include as much information as possible about the potential vulnerability. Steps to reproduce or proof of concept (POC) can help us understand the nature and scope of the potential issue.

4. Be Responsible: Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any disclosure to the community or public.

We take all security bugs seriously. Thank you for helping to keep our project and our users safe.
